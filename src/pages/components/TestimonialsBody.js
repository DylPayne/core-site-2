              Nadia, I want to thank you for all your hard work with the
              project. I appreciate you, sharing your expertise, listening
              attentively to my needs and preferences and demonstrating
              flexibility to ensure a beautiful and functional design, which not
              only enhances the main bedroom, but complements the rest of my
              house. Your commitment, patience and customer orientation was
              exceptional. The workmanship of the cupboards were of a high
              standard and I appreciated that you, Shaun and Michelle popped in
              during the installation.

              Hi Nadia Thank you for doing such a wonderful job. It was a
              pleasure to work with you: you had good ideas, a good sense of
              reading the client, were professional and always seemed to do what
              you said you would do when you said you would do it. I hope your
              business continues to be a success.

              Dear Shaun, Nadia, Michelle and Team Thank you for the beautiful
              job you did with our kitchen installation. It really is
              spectacular and looks exactly how we pictured it. We look forward
              to working with you on future jobs for other clients.

              “My wife and I have built many homes both overseas and locally and
              never before have we come across such an amazing couple, Shaun and
              Michelle! They were simply amazing not only in their ideas but
              support as well. Building a home so far away from South Africa is
              never an easy task but having Shaun and Michelle in our corner was
              a Godsend and we absolutely love the finished product. We are both
              very proud to be associated with Core Interiors and would
              recommend them without hesitation to anyone who asked.”

              As an architect specialising in residential renovations, I have
              completed several kitchen and joinery projects with Core
              Interiors. They have become my joiner of choice, so much so that I
              had them install my own kitchen recently, for which I have
              received many compliments. I look forward to continuing my
              relationship with Core Interiors and will always recommend them to
              my clients for quality, workmanship and personal service – a real
              pleasure to work with.

              We appreciated your suggestions regarding the design of our
              kitchen. We were impressed with your willingness in helping us
              decide on the colour to use on the cupboards, and then not
              complaining when we ended up painting them white! The project may
              have taken a little longer than we anticipated, but we know that
              you and Daniel did a thorough job. You were reliable – coming to
              site when you said you would. You used high quality materials and
              we are very happy with the end result. We would certainly use you
              again.

              With a background in designing interiors of the highest standards
              internationally my requirements are rigorous and often unusual and
              challenging. When recently I installed extensive new joinery work
              in my own apartment in Cape Town this requirement remained
              unchanged. Core Cabinets and Interiors paid proper attention to my
              drawn design instruction and proved more than able to produce work
              that met my requirements. Core were a pleasure to work with. I
              would be very happy to recommend their high quality service to
              others.

              Many thanks for all the hard work on the cabinet, we are very

              Core Interiors to a couple of people:)

              I have recently completed a renovation and used Core Cabinets for
              the manufacture and installation of a complete new kitchen and
              bedroom cupboards. The project was a good experience – Core were
              friendly, co-operative, honest, efficient, professional, cost
              effective and all workmanship was of the highest quality. As the
              project progressed there was flexibility to implement changes to
              improve upon the original design. We were able to have open and
              honest discussions to achieve an end result that was even better
              than originally planned and yet still within budget. I would not
              hesitate to recommend Core Cabinets to anyone else. In my book
              they stand for quality, personal service and integrity.

              CORE Interiors offered us great advice with design layout when it
              came to redesigning our kitchen. We were very impressed with the
              great use of space and quality workmanship. On top of that our

              Core Cabinets & Interiors have transformed my dated 40 year old
              kitchen into a modern delight. Their cabinetry is superb, and
              their advice on best placements for kitchen furniture and
              appliances has meant that I can move through my kitchen with ease.
              I found the team working for this Company to be totally reliable.
              I was told the work (including building alternations) would take a
              month and that is just how long it took to completion. I find it
              important to have pleasant people working in my home, and I found
              all associated with Core Cabinets & Interiors to be polite,
              patient and most helpful at all times.
