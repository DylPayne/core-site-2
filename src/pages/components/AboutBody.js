          in-house company we personally design, manufacture & install all of

        <h2>The History of Core Cabinets and Interiors</h2>
        <p>
          <br />
          by Lawrence Payne
          <br />
          <br />
          For well over a decade operated my own carpentry and cabinetry
          business, formerly known as L & G Interiors – we operated mainly in
          the upper Claremont, Newlands, Rondebosch and Constantia areas
          supplying clients with quality Kitchens, Cabinets, Built-in-cupboards,
          Home Office fitout and bespoke furniture.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2013 I was joined by my son and his wife who returned to South
          Africa after having completed a successful rugby career playing for
          the Sharks, Swansea and Munster. After an extensive rebranding and
          expansion exercise we changed the business name to Core Cabinets &
          Interiors and register a Private Company.
          <br />
          <br />
          We are firmly of the belief that in an industry where service is not
          great we aim to do just that and always walk away having made a new
          friend.
